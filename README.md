### Notes about the project
- This Repo represents a polished MVP of a news CMS where clients can create articles with GIF images.
- The system has an authentication system. The user is log in, log out and sign up (Laravel) (ps: this is a basic system so admin panel is not implemented at this stage, article creation is done from a specific screen for registered user)
- The search GIFâ€™s API is implemented with NodeJS, the API provider can be easily changed in only one place (settings file)
- to enhance the performance of the search plugin lazy loadiing is implemented, only 20 GIFs are fetched at a time;
- Eloquent Sluggable is used to ensure the uniqueness of the slugs among the articles.
